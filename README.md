# Make-Over-Monday-Submissions
Repository of my entire Make Over Monday submissions. Make Over Monday is a weekly learning exercise which involves creating a data visualization based on a dataset provided every week by the community. This repository contains all of my submissions since I started working in the project from Week 45 of 2019.
